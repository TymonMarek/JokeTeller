Notes:
    All code is made by me besides jokes.txt, which is taken from (https://github.com/yesinteractive/dadjokes/blob/master/controllers/jokes.txt).
    The program is made for Python 3.6.1, but should work with any version of Python 3.
    There are two versions of this program, one with and one without comments.

Troubleshooting errors:
    Make sure the file isn't corrupted. (MD5 hash of "jokeTeller.py" is 1514a995aabb6b33711007fe7aac0125)
    Make sure you have the correct access rights to the required files and modules.
    Make sure you have the required modules installed. (os, random)
    Make sure you have Python 3.11 or newer installed.

Pros:
    Uses a text file instead of being a hard-coded list.
    Fast, easy to use, and easy to understand.
    Lightweight, only 2 KB (Uncommented).
    Works on any version of Python 3.
    Works on any operating system.
    Easy to add more jokes.
    Easy to modify.
    Very flexible.
    Easy to test.

Cons: 
    Method of clearing the console could be improved.
